    "As big fans of the NBA and the sport of basketball, we found this dataset very interesting. There is a lot of interesting information regarding all the NBA players over the years and we are excited to study research questions pertaining to all players in the league. Unlike other datasets, this one is actually a topic of interest for us and gives us the opportunity to both practice data analysis and learn more about the sport we love!\n",

    "### Another dataset we considered:\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes! We were originally going to use another NBA dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/nathanlauga/nba-games?select=games.csv). It also had some very insightful data, however, we felt that it was far more focused on the NBA team's performances, rather than the players. As a group, we were more interested to research the data of the players to visualize talent existent within the league since 1996. "

    "### Here are a few tentative questions that we would like to study for this dataset: \n",
    "\n",
    "1) Calculate the percentage of players that were undrafted. \n",
    "    * To see how many and what players were talented enough to directly sign with an NBA team instead of being drafted.\n",
    "2) What is the average age of the players by season?\n",
    "3) Find the top 5 colleges. \n",
    "    * To see which colleges most players played for before coming to the NBA.\n",
    "4) Find the top 5 countries NBA players are from. \n",
    "    * To see what percentage of players from each unique country\n",
    "5) All-Star player from each unique country? (All-Star player defined as pts: 25+, reb: 7+, ast: 7+). \n",
    "6) Compare first-round, number-one player picks from each draft year.\n",
    "    * To find out whether there were any NBA busts from the draft. \n",
    "7) Determine the position of each player (since it's not provided in the dataset). \n",
    "    * To find the average height per position. \n",
    "8) Does the player's weight affect their performance? \n",
    "9) Who is the longest active player in the league? \n",
    "10) Find the player with the most points, rebounds, and assists, respectively, of all-time. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Methods to Apply to Answer the above: \n",
    "\n",
    "To begin, we will utilize Python's in-built libraries extensively and use multiple functions such as, 'map', 'filter', and 'reduce'. We plan to primarily Numpy for the programming of most of the data as it is mostly comprised of numerical values. However, we expect to learn new things in the near future of this course, including Pandas and Mathplotlib. Both Pandas and Mathplotlib will help greatly to visualize and process the data in different aspects using graphs and charts. Furthermore, we will analyze the data using mathematical, statistical analysis, and attributes to complete conclusions to our questions of research.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Potential for Data Science Applications: \n",
    "\n",
    "There is great potential to apply our knowledge of data science and translate it to the data of NBA players. We can predict players' performance and development over their NBA career. In a real-life scenario, we can recommend colleges to those interested to join the NBA for their future. We can also simulate the players' projected growth (whether they will become an all-star) and work with the coaching staff to provide them with such information, so they can make the essential adjustments to players' training and development. Most importantly, we would be able to visualize the diversity of players within the NBA. "
